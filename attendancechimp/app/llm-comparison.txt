While both models appear to successfully implement the AttendanceChimp application, there are differences in structure. My data model includes an Attendance class, which streamlines tracking attendance and validating submissions by linking students, lectures, and QR codes. This explicit attendance tracking class helps to enhance clarity, as it allows for post-hoc analysis on attendance data. Additionally, ChatGPT's version of the model includes a User class, which is helpful for promoting code reuse, but added a bit of abstraction into the model that may be arguably complex. Overall, I argue that my model is simpler not only intuitively but also thus easier to implement.
